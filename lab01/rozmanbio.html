<body>
My name is Sasha Rozman. I am majoring in Advertising with an interest in the fashion and beauty space. I have been on dean's list for five consecutive semesters and I also received the "Most Promising Advertising Student" award from the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications. My favorite tv show is Mad Men and my favorite movie is The Big Short. I have an older sibling and a dog. I love hanging out with my friends, reading books, and shopping. I am happy to be a Syracuse University student!
