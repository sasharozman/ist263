<h2>Why are People Joining The Tiny House Movement?</h2>
<p>The popularity of tiny homes continues to increase in the midst of financial and environmental
    concerns, both important factors for Americans in this day in age. In 2008, in the midst of the
    United States financial downfall, the movement started becoming more popularized as people
    were struggling to pay their monthly mortgage and some on the brink of foreclosure. In fact, tiny
    homes are increasingly being used to solve homelessness and the housing crisis, due to the
    increase in rent in major cities, throughout the country by building tiny house
    villages. Thus, there are three main reasons why people are turning to tiny homes: affordability, a
    smaller carbon footprint, and life simplification.</p>

<h3>Affordability</h3>

    <p>For most Americans, 1/3rd to ½ of their income goes to keeping a roof
    over their heads. In fact, it is quite common for those living in a single-family home to pay off
    their home in a 15+ year mortgage. It is the cultural norm in the United States to put hundreds of
    thousands of dollars into purchasing a home, from the purchase price to the downpayment to
    interest to taxes and more.</p>
    <h4>Where Does All of This Money Go?</h4>
    <p>It allows you to continue to live
        in a large house that is difficult to afford in order to fill it with more stuff. This is one of the
        reasons why many people turn to tiny homes. A tiny house can cost anywhere between $10,000
        to $100,000 depending on the quality of materials, labor cost, solar energy tools, and the medium
        in which you are building your tiny home (i.e shipping containers, vehicles, yurts). Many people
        who live in a tiny home often build the home themself, which cuts the labor costs. Some tiny
        homes are “off-the-grid” meaning they do not connect to any public supplies such as water, gas,
        electricity, and sewage systems. The tiny home would be generated by solar panels, rainwater
        collection tanks, composting toilets, and propane tanks for heating stoves or running a
        refrigerator. </p>
    <h4>What Does This Mean?</h4>
    <p> Essentially if one lives in an off-the-grid home they do not
        pay any utilities. On the other hand, if a tiny home is hooked up to public lines, you do pay
        utilities, but significantly lower than a single-family home due to the size of the house. Many
        tiny home buyers pay out of pocket for the cost of the home, due to its low price, but in the case
        of a loan, you would not have a 15+ year mortgage and high interest rates. With a tiny home,
        your bills can ultimately disappear.</p>   
    
<h3>A Smaller Carbon Footprint</h3>

    <p>In the age of concerning and immediate threats of climate
        change, tiny homes can be the solution to help the earth. In fact, Virginia Tech conducted a study
        of 80 tiny-house owners and found that their “ecological footprints were reduced by about 45%
        on average.”</p>
    <h4>How is This Possible?</h4>
    <p> Living in a smaller space costs less because there is less
        energy used for heating and air conditioning. Many tiny homes use solar panels for electricity
        purposes, which can save upwards of 90% of energy to cool or heat a home. In addition, building
        white roofs on a tiny home is common in order to keep the home cooler along with solar panels.
        Living in a small home means throwing away less food which equates to generating less waste.
        Food waste contributes up to 8% of global greenhouse emissions, therefore it is not unusual for
        those living in a tiny home to have a garden to produce their own food. Lastly, composting toilets
        can reduce household water consumption by thousands of gallons a year. These toilets use little
        to no water and turn the waste into a fertilizer for the environment. This, in turn, not only helps
        the earth but guarantees more promising soil for growing food. In an ordinary flushing toilet, the
        organic waste decomposes in a landfill which produces methane and leachate formulation which
        contributes to climate change.</p>
    
<h3>Life Simplification</h3>

    <p>In a time of constant surplus of information and materialistic ideals,
        tiny homes can be a great way to ground yourself and relax. They allow you to live life on your
        own terms, not the traditional flawed system of living paycheck to paycheck that comes with
        constant obligations and stress. Living in a tiny home means simplifying your life. Owning fewer
        things simplifies your life physically and mentally. It forces you to question and choose what is
        important in life, which can feel like a weight lifted off your shoulders. Lastly, less space inside a
        home means more time to spend outside. In this digital age, everyone is obsessed with their
        phone and in fact living life through their cameras. When joining the tiny house movement, you
        can actually start living your life in real-time by enjoying the earth’s nature. It is important to
        take in the fresh air, the flowers, and the views because it is so often overlooked. Especially, with
        the newly found financial freedom, you can enjoy earth’s natural gifts around the world by
        traveling.</p>
    <h4>Does Living with More Stuff Truly Make People Happy?</h4>
    <p>The tiny house movement challenges that idea to say living with less leads to a more fulfilled life.</p>
