<h2>What is a Tiny House?</h2>
<p>According to the 2020 United States Census Bureau, the average American single-family home
    is around 2,300 square feet. <br> While there is no official definition of a tiny house, it is typically
    between 100 and 400 square feet. A tiny house is rarely <br>over 500 square feet.

<p>Simply put, the Tiny House Movement is a social movement that encourages living a more
    simplistic lifestyle. Living in a larger home<br> and the cost associated with it, for many, is a
    detriment to their happiness. Thus, people have turned to tiny homes to lessen the emotional<br> and
    financial burden of stuff and embrace the freedoms that come with the lifestyle.
