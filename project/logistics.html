<h2>Where Can I Park My Tiny House?</h2>
<p>Needless to say, this is the biggest problem that comes with tiny houses. Zoning rules and laws
    vary from state to state, county to county, and even town to town. <br>So, where can you park your
    home? Here are the best places:</p>
    
    <h3>RV Parks and Campgrounds</h3>

        <p> This may not sound ideal at first, but give it a chance.
            Often private RV parks create special spaces for tiny houses, thus grouping together and creating
            a mini-community. <br>A private RV park has fewer regulations than a public one which can limit
            how long you are able to stay. Campgrounds often have the ability for a tiny house to hook up to<br>
            public supplies.
            </p>

    <h3>Federal Land</h3>

        <p> There are over 600 million acres across America owned and overseen by
            the federal government. Federal land is opened to “dispersed camping” meaning you are able to
            stay <br>and park on the land for free. This is the best option if you want to travel with your tiny
            home.
            </p>
    
    <h3>Tiny House Communities</h3>
        <img src="https://sasharozman.github.io/ist263/project/sitemedia/ijerph-17-00661-g005.jpg" alt="Tiny House Community" width="400" height="267">    
        <p> From California to Texas, tiny house communities are
            growing exponentially. This allows for an amazing community feel with shared interests. Many
            communities offer power, <br>water, and internet hookups for a monthly cost. Very often, they will
            have events and amenities from BBQs, walking trails, and even pools.            
            </p>
            
    <h3>Private-Owned Land</h3>
        <img src="https://sasharozman.github.io/ist263/project/sitemedia/facebookgroup.png" alt="Private Land" width="300" height="267">    
        <p>  Thousands of tiny house owners are connecting with people
            looking to make some extra cash through the Facebook group “Tiny House Hosting”. With over
            18,000 members this<br> Facebook group helps “connect land-owners with tiny house people and
            bridge the connection.” Whether that’s farmland or a piece of land right outside the city, this
            group may be<br> the best option while saving money for land of your own.            
            </p>
            
    <h3>Your Own Land</h3>
        <img src="https://sasharozman.github.io/ist263/project/sitemedia/Tiny_House__33_of_45_.0.jpg" alt="Own Land" width="400" height="267">    
        <p>  While this may be the most expensive option upfront, this is ideal for
            the long term. With owning your own land you decide what you can and want to do with it such
            as parking your<br> own tiny home. This option is the most private and offers a greater sense of
            security and stability.
